I'm currently a graduate student in "Transportation Engineering":http://www.engineering.pitt.edu/Civil/Graduate/Programs/Transportation_Engineering/ at the University of Pittsburgh:http://www.pitt.edu. I have my BS is Molecular Biology and Math, and before starting grad school I worked at the "Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center":http://www.psc.edu and then at startups in the area, including "ShowClix":http://showclix.com, "ShoeFitr":http://shoefitr.com, and co-founded "Chogger":http://chogger.com. 

I'm married to the wonderful Anne who is a Ph.D. canidate in Pitt's "Pharmacology":http://www.pharmacology.us/ program and did her BA at "Amherst":https://www.amherst.edu/. !{float:right;width:200px}/img/anne-and-i-infront-of-the-taj--mahal.jpg(Anne and I in front of the Taj Mahal)! When not being a half-elf ranger, she enjoys reading, play games with her hubby and friends, and needle-pointing ("sample1":/img/xmas-orniment-marriage.jpg "sample2":/img/xmas-orniment-engineer.jpg).

When I'm not a half-orc fighter or playing games with my wife and friends, I enjoy working on projects (sometimes too many at once, but that's a topic for a book, or two).  I cofounded "Chogger":http://chogger.com and "RedColony":http://redcolony.com and there is a lot of work to do on those still. (Is a website ever really finished?) I also like to model railroad (N-Scale, Pennsy Transition era) and railfan (mostly in this part of the country, but wouldn't mind exploring elsewhere either), and am a member of the "Pennsylvania Trolley Museum":http://www.pa-trolley.org/.
